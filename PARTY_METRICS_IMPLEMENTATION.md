# Party Metrics Visualization - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the infrastructure for a new `partyMetrics` visualization following the established patterns in the CivisAnalysis2 codebase.

## Changes Made

### 1. Constants Definition (`javascripts/core/constants.js`)
- Added `PARTY_METRICS = 11` constant to define the new chart type
- Updated `typeChartToString` array to include "Party Metrics" label

### 2. Chart Initialization (`javascripts/charts/chart-initializer.js`)
- Added `PARTY_METRICS` case to the main `initializeChart()` switch statement
- Created `initializePartyMetrics()` function following the established pattern:
  - Instantiates the `partyMetrics()` chart
  - Adds config menu with 'party-metrics' identifier
  - Adds edit title input functionality
  - Sets data-type-period attribute for panel tracking

### 3. Event Handlers (`javascripts/events/event-handlers.js`)
- Created `handleContextMenuPartyLegend()` function to handle context menu interactions
- Function extracts:
  - Panel ID from the invoked element
  - Party name from D3 data binding
  - Period information for title generation
- Constructs appropriate title and subtitle based on period type (year/legislature/custom period)
- Creates chart object with all necessary data and passes it to `createNewChild()`

### 4. Visualization Module (`javascripts/party-metrics.js`)
- Created new file following D3.js reusable chart pattern
- Implemented basic structure:
  - Margin convention for proper spacing
  - SVG container with responsive viewBox
  - D3 dispatch system for event handling
  - Getter/setter methods for dimensions
  - Placeholder rendering function ready for D3 implementation
- Currently displays placeholder text - ready for actual visualization implementation

### 5. HTML Integration (`index.html`)
- Added `<script>` tag to load `party-metrics.js` in the correct order (after other visualizations, before modular architecture)
- Created `contextMenuPartyLegend` menu with "Show Party Metrics" option
- Menu positioned alongside existing context menus (scatter plot, timeline, deputy)

### 6. Scatter Plot Integration (`javascripts/scatter-plot.js`)
- Added context menu binding to legend items in `updateLegend()` function
- Context menu triggers on right-click of any party in the legend
- Passes selected party data to the event handler

## Architecture Pattern Followed

The implementation strictly follows the existing architecture:

1. **Constants Layer**: Chart type defined in central constants file
2. **Initialization Layer**: Chart initialization delegated to chart-initializer module
3. **Event Handling Layer**: Context menu handling in event-handlers module
4. **Visualization Layer**: Self-contained D3 chart module with reusable pattern
5. **UI Layer**: Context menu defined in HTML, integrated via jQuery contextMenu plugin

## Data Flow

```
User Right-Clicks Party Legend (scatter-plot.js)
    ↓
Context Menu Displayed (index.html)
    ↓
User Selects "Show Party Metrics"
    ↓
handleContextMenuPartyLegend() called (event-handlers.js)
    ↓
Chart Object Created with party & panel data
    ↓
createNewChild() called (panel-manager.js)
    ↓
initializeChart() routes to initializePartyMetrics() (chart-initializer.js)
    ↓
partyMetrics() chart instantiated (party-metrics.js)
    ↓
Visualization rendered in new panel
```

## Next Steps

The infrastructure is complete and ready for D3 visualization implementation in `party-metrics.js`. The `renderPartyMetrics()` function should be implemented to:

1. Fetch deputy data for the selected party from the source panel
2. Calculate relevant metrics (voting patterns, alignment scores, etc.)
3. Create appropriate D3 visualizations (bar charts, line charts, statistics, etc.)
4. Implement interactive features as needed
5. Add proper styling and legends

## Testing Checklist

- ✅ Constants properly defined
- ✅ Chart initialization function created
- ✅ Event handler implemented
- ✅ Visualization module created with proper structure
- ✅ HTML integration complete
- ✅ Context menu wired to scatter plot legends
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ Follows existing architectural patterns
- ✅ All referenced functions exist in codebase

## Files Modified

1. `javascripts/core/constants.js` - Added constant and label
2. `javascripts/charts/chart-initializer.js` - Added initialization logic
3. `javascripts/events/event-handlers.js` - Added event handler
4. `javascripts/scatter-plot.js` - Added context menu to legends
5. `index.html` - Added script tag and context menu HTML

## Files Created

1. `javascripts/party-metrics.js` - New visualization module

## No Breaking Changes

All changes are additive and follow existing patterns. No existing functionality has been modified or broken.
